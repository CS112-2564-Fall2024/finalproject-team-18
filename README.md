For my final project I re-created the Blackjack game.
The purpose of this was just to have fun with it and explore the difficulties of creating games.
Although it was very difficult to create this project I learned a lot about creating logic and I look forward to implementing this strategy into my future projects.

Note: My UML diagram is from UD1 and I just created my program off from there. It is not accurate for the program that I ended up creating (This program).
